    "description": "This repository contains a sample implementation of Fanout Architecture using .NET6 Worker Services to process messages from Amazon SNS Topic and Amazon SQS Queue. Since the Worker Services would have no UI, to operate this solution, you need Observability implemented. In this repository, you can also find sample .NET Observability implementation using the combination of AWS X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch. To provision this solution, you can use AWS CDK to implement your modern Infrastructure as Code, using .NET C# to provision all AWS Resources your application needs.",
