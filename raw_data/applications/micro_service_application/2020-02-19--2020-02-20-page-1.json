    "description": "Ready-mix concrete is a tailor-made concrete that is manufactured in a factory or within a batching plant as per the specified requirements. It is thereafter transported to the worksite via transit mixers mounted over a truck. This specific technology has tons of advantages besides being economical and environmentally friendly as compared to the traditional methods used in the manufacturing industry.  Here are some of the significant advantages of Ready mix concrete that makes it a must-use for mass concrete construction.  Assured superior quality of concrete. Fast-tracks the project.  Manufactured at a factory/batching plant, it ensures a significantly lesser pollution level.  Minimizes the need of the storage area and wastage of raw concrete materials  Considered as an energy-efficient construction material for buildings and homes.  Instant application and eliminates the need for a large labor-force and supervision.    According to a study, Ready Mix concrete holds about 60% share in the total concrete used in the construction industry. Experts say the reason behind the tremendous growth and demand of RMC is because it is affordable and offers great diversity with regards to the function and design of the structure.  It is used for various purpose namely for  Civil engineering works and building projects structures (bridges, tunnel, covered trenches, bulkheads, tiles, columns, girders)  Construction of conservatories, homes, and basement conversions. Roads and driveways development.  Dinesh Concrete, based out in Bhubaneswar, brings this wonderful technology at affordable prices in Odisha and is one of the largest independent and leading concrete suppliers of RMC in the state. The company manufactures and supplies Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) from Grade M7.5 to M70 & more. It has three plants, one situated in Khurda and two plants in Hansapal of Odisha.  It facilitates manufactured concrete that to the purchaser in a plastic and unhardened state. The concrete is first mixed in a stationary mixer in a centrally located batching and mixing plant or in a truck-mixer and then supplied in fresh condition to the purchaser either at the site or into the purchaserâ€™s vehicles.  The company supplies an array of products like  Fillet (which is Pumpable lean concrete suitable for backfilling, alternate to compact fill & foundation base with low compressive strength, easy to place.) Fibrex (Ready mix polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete that helps to control shrinkage & micro-cracks in early-stage, improves the overall quality of a structure.)  Steel fiber concrete- Ready Mix concrete with increased ductility allowing superior load-bearing capacity. An economical & safe structural floor, slab rested on the ground with thickness > 100mm, i.e., Industrial floor, commercial floor-warehouses & showrooms, housing pavements- society road, parking lots, etc.  Lightweight concrete- Low density, efficient thermal concrete, density low as 600-1800 Kg/m3. It enhances thermal insulation and effectively replaces brickbat coba, concrete screed, filling of an area like sunken portions, backfilling, void filling, etc. Lightweight floor and roof screed, thermal insulation.  Details of the more products are available in the product and service section. Do visit https://abdinesh.com/ or reach us at sales@abdinesh.com for more information about our products and services.
