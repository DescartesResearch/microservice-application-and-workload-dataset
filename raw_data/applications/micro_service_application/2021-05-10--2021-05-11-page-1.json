    "description": "An International logistics company is looking towards making their deliveries more agile and high speed and to achieve this, they wanted to drive their application lifecycle management through their devops initiatives.Logistics are also migrating to SOA or Micro services architectures. They ended up creating lots of APIs. For testing, they use Swagger / Postman etc but when it comes to meta data itâ€™s hard to manage. Swagger is one of the best ways to do that. you can add meta data about resource, end points and individual fields. This makes things easy for other people as they can now get information about any API whichever required.",
