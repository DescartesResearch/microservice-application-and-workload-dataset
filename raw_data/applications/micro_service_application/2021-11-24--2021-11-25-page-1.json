    "description": "In this code pattern, we will integrate Instana with a polyglot microservice travel application on OpenShift. Instana is a fully automated Enterprise Observability solution, with infrastructure monitoring and Application Performance Management (APM), designed specifically for the challenges of managing microservice and cloud-native applications. We will generate traffic to the application using Puppeteer and analyze the traffic on the Instana dashboard. The travel application used in this code pattern is a part of the Bee Travels project that focuses on some of the first version services of the application.",
