    "description": "Python is one of the most loved programming languages by developers, data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features. Many of the web and mobile applications we enjoy today is because of Python’s abundant libraries, various frameworks, vast collections of modules, and file extensions. Not only that, Python is great for building micro-project to macro enterprise web services as well as on supporting other types of programming languages.  Although it’s a high-level language and can do complex tasks, Python is easy to learn and has a clean syntax. Therefore, its recommendable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Also, there are plenty of ways on how to learn Python; you can do self-study or you can download resources from my GitHub repository. The choice is yours to make!",
