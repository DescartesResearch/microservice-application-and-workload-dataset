    "description": "In part I of our refactoring series we talked about what is code refactoring, and why it deserves an investment during development.  Part II was all about when to choose to refactor, what situations it’s absolutely crucial to refactor in, and our teams take on the clean code approach. In Part III we highlighted consideration points and…  Read More What is Code Refactoring and Why Should You Do It? Part I of V Mini-Tech Series By Editorial Team | April 13, 2022  Sometimes code can go bad faster than guacamole left on the table after a couple of hours. Code refactoring is the process of cleaning up and revamping the underlying code behind the curtain so it runs cleaner without changing how it functions for end-users. Everything on earth tends to decay after a certain amount of…  Read More The Ultimate Guide to Secure Access Service Edge Computing (SASE) By Editorial Team | January 18, 2022  Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) — defined by Gartner — is a security framework for enabling secure and fast cloud adoption, and helping ensure both users and devices have secure access to applications, data and services anywhere, any time.  Read More Dual Track Scrum: Two Roads to the Future By Editorial Team | May 5, 2021  One of the most persistent challenges in getting a project off the ground is coordinating workflows between the teams responsible for different aspects of the project. In particular: discovery and development. At times, it can seem like bringing together two different countries with different languages and cultures. Because of the differences in the way each…  Read More Hyperautomation: How Can Small and Medium-Sized Companies Capitalize on it? By Editorial Team | March 2, 2021  No matter how you spell hyper-automation (you’ll see it with and without the hyphen too), it may sound like a sci-fi concept—like the hyperdrive the Millennium Falcon was continually struggling with. You may already understand how automation removes headaches and makes several business processes more manageable and more efficient. But hyper-automation? Why all the hype?…  Read More Leveraging AI for Small Business By Editorial Team | February 4, 2021  Small businesses employ almost half of the workers in the United States. In Europe, more than a third of workers were employed by small businesses. Various estimates put overall global employment by small businesses at around 7 of every 10 people. Most of those numbers came before the pandemic hit, however. Unfortunately, these small businesses…  Read More Dangers and Solutions of Cloud Misconfiguration By Editorial Team | January 21, 2021  Cloud computing has exploded over the past few years as more and more organizations move major sectors of their operations there. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated that migration now that the physical location of work matters less and less. Of course, cloud computing brings incredible benefits and growth opportunities. But it also brings security…  Read More The Benefits of AI-Assisted Software Development By Editorial Team | December 10, 2020  Software. It’s the ocean that we all swim in, day in and day out. From the apps we rely on from dawn to dusk in our personal lives to the major applications and systems we use to accomplish myriad strategic business objectives, software truly makes our world go around. So, when there’s a software glitch…  Read More Stateless vs. Stateful Microservices: Addressing the Benefits and Quandaries By Editorial Team | November 12, 2020  Is an application stateful or stateless? And what does that mean?
