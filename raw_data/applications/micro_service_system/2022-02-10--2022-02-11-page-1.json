    "description": "The goal of this project is to show how to handle two microservices in the same repository using docker. The microservices are communicating with each other using a rest gateway. The client can then only connect to the system using the public gateway.  The good thing on this type of architecture is that the client does not need to query separately each services. It also make the whole structure easier to maintain.",
