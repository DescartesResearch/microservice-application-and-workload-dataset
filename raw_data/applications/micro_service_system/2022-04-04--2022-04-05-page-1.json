    "description": "When debugging microservices, it can be challenging for developers to identify the root cause of issues. Not to mention how frustrating it is to search through endless logs across multiple services and the time it takes them.  With all these challenges, however, there is a silver lining — distributed tracing.  Distributed tracing can help your developers with tracking requests across services (but more on that later).  Let’s dive into what is distributed tracing, its benefits, and the role it plays in your teams’ system. Then we’ll cover which tools developers can use to implement distributed tracing in a cloud native environment.  But first, to understand where tracing fits in your microservices debugging process and why you might even need them in the first place, let’s identify the challenges that debugging with logs pose.",
