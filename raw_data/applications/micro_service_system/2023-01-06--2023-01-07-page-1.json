    "description": "In this project, I have applied the skills I acquired in the cloud engineering course to design, deploy and operate a cloud native photo sharing application. I reused my existing application and converted and extended it into a microservice architecture. The microservice architecture makes it more easier to scale it to large systems. They are great enablers for continuous integration and delivery too. This includes independent scaling, independent releases and deploymentsâ€Š and independent development so that ACH service has its own codebase. After the application is divided into smaller services, I containerized it and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes deployment pipeline, scalability, observability, Services, Networking and deployment strategies to service the system. I have implemented and interpreted performance, usage, and logs to solve real problems similar to those they would encounter in the field.",
