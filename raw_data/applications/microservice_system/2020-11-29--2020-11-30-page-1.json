    "description": "ACECAM Pvt. Ltd  Work progress - Nishan Shashintha   After exploring the existing system, now I have a moderate idea about the Inventory module and the other modules which are integrated with the Inventory module. So basically I have sketched the table diagram of the Inventory module.   Mainly I have referred to the following to utilize the system functions and security of the data.    Spring LDAP  Spring LDAP is a library to simplify LDAP programming in Java, built on the same principles as Spring Jdbc.  The LdapTemplate class encapsulates all the plumbing work involved in traditional LDAP programming, such as creating, looping through NamingEnumerations, handling Exceptions and cleaning up resources. This leaves the programmer to handle the important stuff - where to find data (DNs and Filters) and what to do with it (map to and from domain objects, bind, modify, unbind, etc.), in the same way that JdbcTemplate relieves the programmer of all but the actual SQL and how the data maps to the domain model.  (Documentation)   Spring Security  Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements  (Documentation)      Spring Rest Service  REST has quickly become the de-facto standard for building web services on the web because they’re easy to build and easy to consume.  There’s a much larger discussion to be had about how REST fits in the world of microservices, but - for this tutorial - let’s just look at building RESTful services.  Why REST? REST embraces the precepts of the web, including its architecture, benefits, and everything else. This is no surprise given its author, Roy Fielding, was involved in probably a dozen specs which govern how the web operates.   (Documentation)   Now I have developed two separate web applications.
